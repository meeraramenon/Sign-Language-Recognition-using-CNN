# Sign-Language-Recognition-using-CNN
<p>Sign Language Recognition implemented using Convolutional Neural networks, tensorflow, keras and OpenCV framwork.</p>
<p>AIM: To detect the hand gesture and display the appropriate alphabet. </p>
<p>This given project does not have a front end and is completely theory based. The front end is still under work and will uploaded later on.</p>
The following packages should be installed (installation commands) :
<ul>
  <li>pip install keyboard </li>
  <li>python -m pip install tensorflow --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org </li>
  <li>For upgradation use the following command: pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0 iv.	pip install keras </li>
  <li>pip install keras </li>
  <li>pip install pillow</li>
  <li>pip install qimage2ndarray </li>
  <li>pip install scipy </li>
  <li>pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.16 </li>
  <li>pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16 </li>
  </ul>
  
 <p> The Capture.py is used for creating the train and test datasets. </p>
 <p> The cnn_model.py is used to build the trained model by taking the pictures, passing them through the convolution layers and classifying them as one of the 26 alphabets. </p>
 <p> The Recognise.py is used to take the input, compare it with the trained model and then the output is shown. </p>
 
 It is advisable to build ones own dataset in order to increase the learning curve, but if you need the dataset, contact me on:

 <p> This project was done under the guidance of <b> Mr. Shadab Sheikh </b> </p>
